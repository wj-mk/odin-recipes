        <li>250g/9oz ricotta</li>
        <li>250g/9oz mascarpone</li>
        <li>85g/3oz pesto</li>
        <li>¼ nutmeg, finely grated</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To assemble</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 dried lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>50ml/2fl oz double cream</li>
        <li>25g/1oz Parmesan (or vegetarian hard cheese), finely grated</li>
        <li>fresh salad, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 8 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, oregano and sugar and season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook for 5 minutes then remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, to make the filling, mix the spinach, ricotta, mascarpone, pesto and nutmeg together in a bowl and season with plenty of salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. To assemble the lasagne, lightly grease a 20x30x5cm/8x12x2in ovenproof dish. Spoon a third of the tomato sauce into the base then dollop over a quarter of the ricotta mixture. Swirl it through to create an even layer.</li>
        <li>Layer over 4 lasagne sheets, breaking them to fit snugly and cover the sauce. Repeat with another third of the tomato sauce, a further quarter of the ricotta mixture and a layer of lasagne sheets. Repeat again so the lasagna sheets are on top and there is still a quarter of ricotta mixture left.</li>
        <li>Gently mix the cream into the remaining ricotta mixture and spread this over the top layer of pasta. Sprinkle with the hard cheese and bake for 40-50 minutes. Serve immediately with salad, if preferred.</li>
    </ol>
